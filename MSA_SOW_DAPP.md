**Statement of Work**

**cNIGHT Generates DUST DApp**

This Statement of Work is made on July 23th, 2025 and is issued under and subject to all the terms and conditions of the Master Services Agreement dated as of July 23th,2025, between Shielded Technologies (UK) Ltd **(“*Customer*”)** and **Altoros, LLC (dba Protofire)** **(“*Supplier*”)**. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. 

1. **Start Date:**  8/4/2025

**Required Completion Date:** 10/28/2025

2. **High Level Description of Services:** 

Develop a Cardano DApp that enables users to register their Cardano address (holding cNIGHT) to a Midnight DUST address, allowing them to generate DUST based on their holdings. The app should follow the architecture of the Midnight protocol and utilize CMST for cross-chain event propagation.

**Solution Architecture Overview**

### **Cardano Layer**

* **User Wallet** (CIP-30)

* **cNIGHT UTXOs** (including frozen tokens during Glacier Drop)

* **Mapping Validator Contract**:

  * Stores on-chain mappings of Cardano PubKeyHash → Midnight DUST public key  
  * Accepts registration, updates, and deregistration transactions.

* **Cardano Node / db-sync**:

  * Required by Observability Layer for real-time block monitoring

### **Observability Layer**

* **Runs off-chain, maintained by Midnight block producers**

* Continuously observes:

  * Mapping Validator state (registration UTXOs)  
  * cNIGHT UTXO creation and spending

* Emits CMSTs (Cardano-based Midnight System Transactions) containing NgDPayloadEntry

### **Midnight Layer**

* **CMST Handler (partner chain logic)**:

  * Receives and verifies CMST transactions  
  * Updates Midnight ledger with:  
    * DustGenerationInfo upon cNIGHT reception  
    * SetDestructionTime upon UTXO spent

* **DUST address validation**:

  * Validate the correctness of a provided DUST address using the provided Wallet SDK.

* **DUST Ledger State**:

  * Holds shielded token records (requires viewing key)  
  * Applies DUST generation and decay logic to each DustOutput

* **Privacy & Balance State:**  
  * Viewing Key Integration: DUST balances accessible only via Wallet API  
  * Client-Side State: Private balance calculations handled locally    
  * Public Indexer: Transaction confirmations and public state only  
  * Kachina Model: Clear separation between public (blockchain) and private (user device) states

### **Indexing & Query Layer**

* **Midnight Indexer**:

  * Exposes REST/GraphQL API endpoints  
  * Enables querying DUST balances and metadata with viewing key  
  * Source of truth for dApp dashboards

### **dApp Layer (Frontend)**

* React-based frontend (wallet-agnostic via CIP-30)

* Views:

  * Wallet connection & registration  
  * Dashboard with cNIGHT/DUST states  
  * UTXO breakdown & lifecycle  
  * Transaction feedback

* Consumes:

  * Cardano tx interface (tx submit APIs)  
  * Midnight Indexer (DUST data via viewing key)

## **User End-to-End Flow Overview: From cNIGHT to DUST in the App**

1. **User receives cNIGHT** (including frozen tokens during events like Glacier Drop)

2. **User visits the DApp and connects their Cardano wallet** via CIP-30

**User registers their DUST public Key** by submitting a transaction to the **Mapping Validator** on Cardano, creating a UTXO with the correct datum:

 {  
  user\_pkh: PubKeyHash,  
  dust\_address: DustPublicKey  
}

3. This registration UTXO is **stored on the Cardano blockchain** in the validator state

4. **Block producers on Midnight observe Cardano** (including Mapping Validator and cNIGHT UTXOs)

5. Upon detection of a valid mapping \+ incoming cNIGHT UTXO, they generate a **CMST** transaction with a NgDPayloadEntry type Create

6. The CMST is published on Midnight, updating its ledger with a DustGenerationInfo and DustOutput  
   The nonce of DustGenerationInfo will be:  
   nonce \= hash(tx\_hash || output\_index)

7. If the cNIGHT UTXO is later spent, a Destroy CMST entry is generated, triggering DUST decay

8. The **Midnight Indexer** captures these events and allows querying them via an API

9. The DApp, using the user’s **viewing key**, queries the Indexer to:

   * Retrieve active and expired DustGenerationInfo  
   * Get the current DUST balance and decay timelines  
   * Populate dashboards and views accordingly

10. The DApp, using the user's **viewing key**, queries the Wallet API to:

    * Retrieve current DUST balance (calculated client-side)  
    * Get active and expired DustGenerationInfo   
    * Display DUST generation/decay timelines  
    * **Note: DUST balance is private data, only accessible to wallet owner**

11. DUST Balance Display:

    * Real-time balance updates via Wallet.state() observable  
    * Privacy indicators  
    * Sync progress tracking (backend lag, wallet lag)

## **Dapp Architecture: Frontend Structure & User Views**

### **1\. Landing / Connection View**

* **Purpose**: Connect the user's Lace Cardano wallet.

* **Elements**:

  * Connect Wallet button  
  * Supported wallets (at first Lace, but agnostic)  
  * Explanation of what the DApp does

* **Dependencies**: CIP-30 wallet integration

### **2\. Registration View**

* **Purpose**: Allow the user to register their Cardano wallet with a DUST Public Key.

* **Elements**:

  * DUST address input (public key format)  
  * Validations (checksum, format, datum format)  
  * Register button (submits a tx to Mapping Validator)

### **3\. Main Dashboard View**

* **Purpose**: Display cNIGHT holdings, DUST production, and settings.

* **Elements**:

  * Wallet address and connection status  
  * DUST balance (via  Wallet API \+ viewing key)  
    **Privacy notice**: "Your balance is private and calculated locally"   
  * Registered DUST address (on-chain)  
  * Buttons: Refresh / Update / Deregister

### **4\. UTXO Detail View (Modal)**

* **Purpose**: List and describe the state of cNIGHT UTXOs.

* **Elements**:

  * UTXO table (TxHash, index, amount, time)  
  * Status tags: Producing / Not Producing  
  * Inactivity reasons: No mapping, already spent, frozen, etc.

### **5\. DUST Lifecycle View (Modal)**

* **Purpose**: Visualize DUST decay and production.

* **Elements**:

  * Decay timeline graph  
  * Tooltip with timestamps and values  
  * History of generation and decay events

### **6\. Settings / Update View**

* **Purpose**: Update the registered DUST address.

* **Elements**:

  * Current mapping display  
  * New DUST address input \+ update button  
  * Deregister button

### **7\. Transaction Status Modal**

* **Purpose**: Communicate transaction progress.

* **Elements**:

  * Loading indicator  
  * Success/failure messages  
  * Transaction hash with link to Cardano explorer

## **Dapp Architecture: Backend & Integration Logic**

### **Mapping Validator Contract (Cardano)**

* On-chain contract using Plutus.

* Valid datum format enforced.

* Observed by Midnight block producers for CMST.

### **Mapping Conflict Resolution** If multiple mappings are detected for a single cardano\_pkh, the Observability Layer must apply a deterministic conflict resolution policy. For example:

* Prefer the most recent valid registration UTXO

* Discard all mappings with duplicate dust\_pubkey

* Log and report mapping conflicts for auditability

Duplicate mappings are allowed on Cardano. This situation will be flagged by the DApp giving the possibily to remove the wrong mapping. 

### **CMST (Cardano-to-Midnight Sync)**

* Block producers observe mapping validator \+ cNIGHT UTXOs

* Generate CMST with NgDPayloadEntry for:

  * Create → when cNIGHT UTXO received (even if frozen)  
  * Destroy → when cNIGHT UTXO is spent

### **DUST Generation Flow**

* Mapping is required for DUST generation.

* DUST generation starts immediately on cNIGHT reception upon proper registration (including frozen tokens).

* DUST logic handled in Midnight; dApp retrieves via Indexer (with viewing key).

### **Data Indexing & Query Layer**

* All CMST-derived data (e.g., DUST generation and decay events) will be queried through the **Midnight Indexer** using the user’s **viewing key**. Direct CMST parsing is not required from the DApp side.

* Midnight Indexer (with viewing key access)

* Tracks:

  * Mapping status  
  * cNIGHT UTXOs  
  * DUST balances and lifecycle

## **Compliance & Security**

* Validate the DUST address before registering

* The Dapp must guide the user to achieve the one-to-one Cardano to Midnight address mapping to result in DUST generation

* Display clear feedback for transaction errors

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

* Provide cleaned-up, commented source code for open source repo (showcase beside other example dApps), in accordance with Shielded has source code requirements guidelines presented here: [https://shielded.atlassian.net/wiki/x/E4ASBg](https://shielded.atlassian.net/wiki/x/E4ASBg) and [https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-template-repo](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-template-repo) . 

* Apply minimal branding elements (Midnight logo, color palette to be provided).

* Ensure dApp is wallet-agnostic and easily integrable with other wallets/dApps.

* **DUST generation must begin immediately upon NIGHT reception, even if frozen (e.g., during Glacier Drop).**

* Mapping must occur **on-chain**, specifically in a Cardano smart contract (Mapping Validator).

* **Cross-browser compatibility**: Full support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.

* **Responsiveness**: Full usability on mobile and tablet devices.

*  **Security**: Transaction signing via secure wallet extension; no private key handling in app.

* **Documentation**: Complete developer documentation and inline code comments for open source release.

* **Testability**: Automated unit and integration tests with mocked APIs for DUST Indexer and Cardano node.

* **Maintainability**: Modular, typed frontend codebase (e.g., React \+ TypeScript).

* **Accessibility**: Compliant with WCAG AA accessibility standards.

## **External Dependencies**

* CIP-30 compatible wallets  
* Access to Cardano node or db-sync  
* Midnight Indexer (with view key)  
* Midnight Wallet SDK  
* Validator & Mapping Smart Contracts  
* Branding assets from Midnight (logo, colors)  
* FIGMA Wireframes

##  **Specific Assumptions**

* **Wallet SDK Availability:** The Midnight Wallet SDK provides stable methods for viewing key operations, private balance calculations, including DUST generation and decay data and UTXO breakdown.   
* **Client-Side Computation**: DUST balance calculations happen locally (on client-side), not on backend servers  
* **Stable Tokenomics Model**: The DUST generation and decay logic will remain largely unchanged once integration work begins.  
* **View Key Handling**: Users will provide their viewing key through the UI or DUST wallet connection; no additional cryptographic work needed to derive or manage keys.

* **Mapping Validator Finalization**: The Plutus validator logic for mapping Cardano addresses to DUST addresses is approved and remains stable during implementation.  
* **No Custom Wallet SDKs**: Integration is limited to standard CIP-30 wallets; there is no need to support non-standard or mobile-only wallets.  
* **Reliable Block Producer Sync**: The CMST generation pipeline (observability layer) is correctly deployed and synchronized with Cardano blocks.  
* **No Middleware Refactoring**: Assumes backend services and CMST interpretation logic do not require intervention or reimplementation by Protofire.

##  **General Assumptions & Constraints**

**1\. Customer Responsibilities**

* Customer will provide comprehensive workflow documentation, business rules, user personas, gaps analysis, and access to stakeholders, and test environments.  
* Customer is responsible for delivering brand assets.  
* A Customer-appointed **Product Manager** and **Technical Lead** with decision-making authority must be available during the project. 

**2\. Design & Prototype**

* Protofire team to design and provide the initial visual design, mockups. Midnight team will provide UX designer for reviews and directional feedback. 

**3\. Technology Stack & Integrations**

* The solution will utilize the agreed-upon stack, React, Node.js, AWS.  
* Any additional integration (third-party APIs, analytics, CI/CD pipelines, on-premises systems) are **out of scope** unless separately scoped and approved.

**4\. Testing & Quality Assurance**

* The customer is responsible for functional and acceptance testing and must complete these activities promptly. Deliverables will be deemed accepted after 15 business days in case no issue is presented by the customer.  
* Protofire will remediate defects within the agreed scope. Requests for new functionality during QA will require a formal change-control.

**5\. Security & Audits**

* Security best practices will be implemented; however, detailed security audits, penetration tests, compliance certifications (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) are **out of scope** and should be arranged by the Customer.

**6\. Team Allocation & Billing**

* Work is allocated under a Time & Materials model with a dedicated team.   
* Protofire reserves the right to replace team members as project needs evolve, maintaining equivalent skill levels.

**7\. Infrastructure & Hosting**

* Customer will provide all hosting infrastructure, including servers, SSL certificates, domains, and licenses. Protofire will specify requirements but not provision or manage infrastructure, backups, monitoring, or disaster recovery. 

**8\. Change Management & Scope Control**

* All agreed features are baselined before development. Any scope changes must follow formal change-control procedures: documented requests, impact analysis (time, cost, quality), approval by the Customer and Protofire, and signed revised estimate before work begins.  
* We assume a stable requirements baseline. Uncontrolled or undocumented changes are **out of scope** and will require separate budgeting .

**9\. Project Governance & Escalation**

* Scope, schedule, budget, and quality will be reviewed during regular checkpoint meetings.  
* An escalation pathway (including budget holder) is expected for timely decision-making.

**10\. MVP & Future Enhancements**

* MVP backlog items and priorities are defined jointly during the Discovery phase.  
* Ideas or enhancements identified beyond the current phase are listed as backlog candidates and will go through impact analysis and change-control before inclusion in future phases.

**11\. Support, Training & Documentation**

* Deliverables include basic handover documentation (architecture overview, setup guide).  
* Extensive user training, operational support, SLA definitions, and comprehensive manuals are **not included** unless explicitly scoped.

**12\. Potential Blockers & Timeline Risks**

Given that the Midnight Network is still in an evolving testnet phase, it is likely that we may encounter blockers that could impact the projected timelines. Any downtime resulting from such blockers—during which our team is unable to proceed—will be considered on a Time & Materials (T\&M) basis.
