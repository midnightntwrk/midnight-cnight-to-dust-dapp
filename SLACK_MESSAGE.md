🚀 **Midnight Wallet v4 API Integration Complete!**

Just shipped a major update to our Midnight wallet integration:

✨ **What's New:**
• Dynamic wallet discovery (no longer limited to mnLace)
• Migrated to v4.x API with `connect()` method
• Full Dust address support - using `getDustAddress()` and `getDustBalance()`
• Proper SDK-based address validation
• Enhanced dashboard showing wallet data directly

🔧 **Key Improvements:**

- Registration now uses Dust addresses (not unshielded)
- All address inputs validate using official SDK
- Better UX with clear data source indicators
- Future-proof wallet discovery system

Ready for review! 🎯
